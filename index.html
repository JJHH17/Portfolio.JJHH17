                <br>
                <p id="aboutMeIntro">Hi, I’m James, a Professional Services Engineer with a strong background in cybersecurity and software development. 
                    I specialize in deploying anti-phishing solutions to enterprise customers, helping organizations strengthen their email security 
                    and protect against evolving threats.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="aboutMe2">With a foundation in .NET development and ISTQB certification, I bring both a developer’s problem-solving mindset and a tester’s 
                    attention to detail to every project I take on. Over the past five years in customer-facing and leadership roles, I’ve built a 
                    reputation for clear communication, technical precision, and a customer-first approach.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="aboutMe3">I hold a BSc in Business with IT, which allows me to bridge the gap between technical solutions and business goals — ensuring 
                    every implementation delivers measurable value. My current focus is on deepening my skills in software engineering and quality assurance to drive 
                    innovation and reliability in every deployment.</p>
